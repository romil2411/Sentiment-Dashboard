# 📊 Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

An interactive and user-friendly dashboard developed using Streamlit, designed for comprehensive sentiment analysis and visualization of textual data. The application empowers users to either input individual text or upload a dataset (such as CSV files) containing multiple text entries. It then performs sentiment classification—categorizing the content into positive, negative, or neutral—and displays insightful visual analytics including dynamic sentiment distribution charts, word clouds, and frequency plots. This dashboard is ideal for gaining meaningful interpretations from data such as customer reviews, social media content, or survey responses, and serves as a valuable tool for businesses, researchers, and data enthusiasts looking to understand public sentiment in a visually intuitive manner.
